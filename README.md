# GoogleHashCode2018
A knapsack-like solution for the 2018 vehicle challange

This is my solution for the 2018 edition of the Google Hash Code contest
My solution hasn't worked as well as I expected, but I'm still proud of it.
I tried to maximaze the raport between the number of points earned by each ride(including the bonus) and the cost of it(including the ride itself).

The problem statement can be found here:
